	<h2>Whoami?</h2>
	<p>I'm just another programmer trying to make it through school. I enjoy programming, playing and watching soccer, and anything else that involves computers and outdoor activities.</p>
	<h2>What's this page for?</h2>
	<p>This is a lab project for a class that I'm taking (CTEC 127). The goal of the assignment is to teach us how to create a <a href="https://pages.github.com">github page</a>. If your reading this, it means I've successfully completed the assignment</p>
	<h2>What's CTEC 127?</h2>
	<p>This is a class at <a href="https://clark.edu">Clark College</a>. The teacher is <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/1803383">Bruce Elgort</a>. I think he's a great professor. Just look at his ratings at <a href="https://ratemyprofessors.com">Rate My Professors</a> and you'll know that I'm saying the truth.</p>
	<h2>Are you enjoying the class?</h2>
	<p>Of course! Nobody can truly say they want to learn how to do web development if they don't enjoy the class.</p>
	<h2>Anything else you have to say?</h2>
